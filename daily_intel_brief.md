• **NVDA**: Volume anomaly—15-min volume equals full-day average (41.7M) with negative volatility (-0.79%) signals institutional selling/capitulation. **Prediction**: Continued downside to $175-178 support. **Risk**: 8/10—high-volume dump, bearish momentum.

• **COIN**: +3.33% hourly volatility on weak volume (273K) indicates low-conviction rally/short squeeze. **Prediction**: Momentum fades; reversal likely below $285 resistance. **Risk**: 6/10—unsustainable pump, no volume confirmation.

• **HNT-USD**: ZERO volume is critical anomaly—data error or liquidity death. **Prediction**: UNTRADEABLE. **Risk**: 10/10—no exit liquidity; verify data immediately.

• **Macro Signal**: Capital flight from large-cap tech into speculative crypto; extreme fragmentation indicates market stress, not healthy rotation.
