**TOP 3 HIGH-CONVICTION BUYS:**

1.  **SOLANA (SOL)**: Volume up 24.5% (USDC pair), 7.9% (USDT pair), 12.6% (USD pair). Price volatility: 3.82% (bottom quartile). Network activity is accelerating across all major pairs while price action remains comatose. Market hasn't priced the usage surge. **BUY.**

2.  **JITO STAKED SOL (JITOSOL)**: Volume up 18.5% (USD pair). Price volatility: 4.89%. Staked derivative is generating independent flow despite underlying SOL price stability. This is composability in action—yield-bearing assets creating their own demand curve. **BUY.**

3.  **LITECOIN (LTC)**: Volume up 15.7% (EUR pair). Price volatility: 7.00%. Legacy chain showing sustained volume growth without corresponding volatility spike. Quiet accumulation under the radar. **BUY.**

**TOP 3 HIGH-RISK SELLS:**

1.  **BITCOIN (BTC)**: Price volatility: 1413.9 (extreme). Zero positive physical growth signals. All momentum is speculative feedback loop. Pure algorithmic noise with no underlying network expansion. **SELL.**

2.  **ETHEREUM (ETH)**: Physical volume declining on critical pairs: -8.9% (USDT), -1.9% (AUD). Price volatility: 106.7 (high). Gas demand is collapsing while price swings intensify—classic detachment signal. **SELL.**

3.  **BITCOIN CASH (BCH)**: Volume growth: -0.4% (flatlined). Price volatility: 7.33% (elevated). Dead-chain syndrome: no user growth, but still enough liquidity for volatile chop. **SELL.**

**DEEP INSIGHT:**

**Staked-derivative decoupling is live.** JITOSOL's 18.5% volume growth vs. SOL's direct metrics reveals that staked assets aren't passive wrappers—they're emerging as distinct asset classes with independent flow dynamics. The market is pricing them as correlated (low volatility tether), but on-chain usage proves they're attracting their own liquidity. This is the next DeFi wave: yield tokens becoming primary trading instruments, not just holding pens. The volatility stability score is a lagging indicator; volume growth is the leading signal.
